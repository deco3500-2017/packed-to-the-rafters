# Travel Pack
## Introduction
Travel Pack is a social mobile and computing app that aims to bring together travellers from around the globe. Travel Pack provides users with a platform that allows them to discover various local events, wifi hotspots and other individuals touring the area. 

## Concept
Travel pack aims to connect travellers with others who are doing the same as them. To do this, the concept is an application that not only tells travellers of the different events around the area but creates events for users and automatically invites people of similar interests together. The concept allows travellers to meet like-minded people while travelling, increasing the chance of creating quality travel buddies who would be interested in doing the same things. 

### How Does TravelPack Achieve This?
The app requires users to create a profile for themselves in which they specify their age and interests. The app then filters through all travellers in the area and creates events based on the common interests. It then automatically sends invites to the users and creates an event chat so the users can do further planning if necessary. The app takes all the hard work out of organising tourist events and meeting friends while travelling. 
Travel Pack additionally marks venues, restaurants and locations on the map with a built in star rating system for users to leave feedback. 

### What Makes this Unique from Existing Solutions?
Travel Pack differs from existing travel applications as it creates events for the users and personalities these events to user interests. Other applications exist that work towards the same goal of bringing people together during travelling and creating a travel community. An app that does this is called ‘Backpackr’ (backpacker.org). These other apps although require the users to organise their own meetups and manually look through the other users interests. 

### Target Audience
Travel Pack aims to reach out to travellers of all kinds. Domestic and international; women and men; adventurous and conservative; the features of this application cater to many demographics and allow travellers from all different backgrounds to come together.

### Personas
In order to gain a better insight as to what features should be included within the platform, personas of potential Travel App users have been created. Examples are shown below:

# The Team
*Pack*ed to The Rafters consists of five team members:

|*Team Member*|*Student Number*|*Description*|*Responsibilities*|
|-------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
|Chris Fuller|43184493|Final year Multimedia Design student. Experienced in graphic design and front end. |Content and Design|
| Kirstyn Jozefowski |43936517| Final year IT student, majoring in UX Design. |Back end, Front end and Design|
| Coleen McKay |43927252| Final year Multimedia Design student. Experienced with graphic design and front end.|Front end, Back end and Design|
| Domenico Poutanen |435742188| Final year IT student, majoring in Software Design. Experienced in front and back end.|Back-end| 
| Emily Toniotti |43921317| Final year Multimedia Design and Marketing and Advertising Student. Experienced with graphic design, user experience and front end. |Front-end, Research and Content|

Domenico Poutanen has been designated the role of scrum master. Where his job is to make sure that all team based communication and problems are dealt with.

Dominico will deal with back-end code development. Chris, Kirstyn, Emily and Coleen will together deal with both front-end development and UX Design of the application. Where needed, team members will cross over into other areas.

Coleen McKay is responsible for logistics, such as meetings minutes and coordination. 
When creating content and code, all team members will be responsible for their own documentation (i.e. User testing, standardisations or JavaDoc)

Decisions will be made based on a democratic vote, assuming all alternatives of the decision have been researched, tested and reasoned. There cannot be cases in which the vote results in a draw, as there are only five team members; however, if there are valid reasons the minority believes the majority decision should not be carried through, and is accompanied with valid research, the case will be looked into further. 

## Meetings
### Meeting Schedule
Meetings are scheduled to occur every week in the workshop (W03). This time slot was chosen as it is the only feasible time we are all able to meet during the week. Each workshop will begin with a brief stand up to ensure everyone is aware of what we are all currently working on. If required, the meeting will then follow on from the stand up to talk about everyone’s workload more in-depth, as well as any research undertaken since the last meeting and testing results. 

### Meeting Guidelines 
Meetings should have a clear purpose and agenda
Meetings will not occur if the stand up has adequately informed all team members of new material, testing and/or research
Team members must provide reasonable notice to the team if extra meetings are needing to be organised

## Communications
The primary method of communication will be via *Slack*. Slack will be utilised for checking project progress, sending specific files, links, etc. We chose Slack as we not only have easy access to the DECO3500 channel, we are also able to implement various integrations and services, such as _Github_ and _todobot_. Whilst Slack will be our primary method of communication, *Facebook Messenger* will be our secondary method of communication regarding quick updates or letting other team members know you may be late to a meeting. Email will be used for formal communication, such as emailing organisations for research or testing participants. In cases of emergency, phone calls will be used to contact other team members.

|*Communication Method*|*Use Case*|
|----------------------|----------|
|Skype/Facebook Call|For auditory communication|
|Slack|Primary communication and collaboration|
|Facebook Messenger|Quick communication|
|Email|Formal Communication|
|Phone Calls|Emergencies|
|Github|Version control/asset management|

## Rule Breaches
|Breach|Conflict Resolution|
|------|-------------------|
|Team members not attending meetings without prior notice|Team resolves conflict through communication with team member. If conflict is not resolved and breach keeps happening, the team will bring conflict to tutors attention.|
|Team members not communicating with team|All methods of communication will be used to try and get in contact with team member. After three instances where a lack of communication by a team member occurs, a team meeting will be scheduled to resolve the issue in person. If the team member is ultimately uncontactable tutors will be notified and the issue will be dealt with through the teaching staff.|
|Team members wanting to work on the same tickets|If team members wish to work on the same tickets, workload will be divided equally. No team member is allowed to claim a ticket as their own and *only* theirs. Workload will split evenly between everyone to ensure working hours are fair. Another instance example is if two people want to work on a small design issue, and one of those people is already working on a design issue, the new design issue will be delegated to the other person to ensure it is fair.|
|Team members not contributing adequately to the project|Instances where a team member is not contributing, a team meeting will be held to resolve the issue. Perhaps the problem lies within the team member not knowing what to contribute; therefore, during the meeting certain tasks will be delegated. If there is no improvement of contribution or effort, another team meeting will be held to see if there are underlying issues regarding the lack of contribution. If there are no underlying issues and contribution does not improve, teaching staff will be notified.|
|Team members plagiarising and not referencing|If a team member chooses to plagiarise in order to increase their contribution, a team meeting will be held to resolve the issue and revert the project to a version without the plagiarised content. As all team members are students of the university, we should all be aware that plagiarism is a breach of the code of conduct; therefore, teaching staff will be notified.|

## Project Plan

The plan for implementing Travel Pack will be a hybrid version of agile and waterfall methodologies where instead of the waterfall original steps of design build and evaluation they are replaced with sprints for features being implemented. Where the hierarchy will be based on the priority of said features. The first step being the most important feature and so on. The overall development due date will be 23rd of October where we will prepare for the final presentation and submission.

Within the sprint steps, we will use agile methodologies to ensure the product is built correctly. As the given implementation is as intended and doesn’t impact the overall application negatively. The agile methods will repeat within the sequence of building then testing. Where testing will ensure that said goal is met. If not repeat the build process until it does. The *Sprint Breakdown* will contain the deadlines of said sprints. However below are a few dot points of said features that will be implemented and tested: Note: This is just a rough list of features. Throughout development more points might be added or modified to benefit the overall development of Travel Pack.

Navigation / Map functionality
Personal profile and information sharing
Event creation
Pairing users

Features will be combined when going through sprints. This is a decision made either towards a limited timeframe or positive combined testing. Where testing and developing with said features will produce positive outcomes towards the overall application. For example this could be either towards faster testing evaluation correlation or both features conflict/ work in correlation with each other.
